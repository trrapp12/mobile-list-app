### DESCRIPTION:

> “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”
>
> — Ryan Holiday, Daily Stoic.

The mission of checkOUT is to inspire you to checkoff the most before you checkout of life.

### THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATES...

🆕 Use of Canvas API

🆕 use of basic JavaScript principles like loops and conditionals to create a randomized, regenerating pattern.

### CHALLENGES I OVERCAME...

This was the first time I used Canvas.  So it was a completely new experience.  The most obvious obstacle is learning the syntax.  After that there was a bit of conceptualizing how to create a grid of boxes that needed to occur through a nested for loop.  

But by far the most challenging was creating a timing function that would work dynamically so the interval on setInterval would be different everytime, but only with a range of 0 - 5 seconds.  My first attempt to accomplish this I created the following: 

```javascript  

    function setTimer() {
         const maxDelay = 2500;
         const delay = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2 + 1) * maxDelay;
         setInterval(() => {
             renderSquares()
             setTimer()
         }, delay)
    }

    setTimer()
    
```
    
My thought was to create a delay with `(Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) + 1 * maxDelay` where `maxDelay = 2500`.  This was unsucessful 1) because the `+1` served no purpose, and 2) because the `Math.floor()` created a situation where it would only return 1 or 5 since the 2 was always getting rounded down to either 0 or 1.  The second issue was that the timing function would start with a random interval, but eventually it would gradually speed up more and more until it became sickenly fast.  I thought at first it was because timesing something by a fraction over and over again will ultimately make it smaller and smaller.  However, when I console.log'ed the issue the interval times were fine.  Then I realized what was happening was every time the function fired it created a separate setInterval instance.  So I had to figure out how to clear them.  I could just add a `clearInterval()` since they were named.  So I discovered I could loop over the window object to find all the intervals and clear them all before setting a new one. This answer worked swimmingly.  The final timer function was this: 

```javascript

    function setTimer() {
        const maxDelay = 2500;
        const delay = (Math.random() * 2) * maxDelay;
        console.log(delay)
        setInterval(() => {
            for (let i = 0; i < 99999; i++) {
                window.clearInterval(i)
            }
            renderSquares()
            setTimer()
        }, delay)
    }

    setTimer()

```

### MY OWN PERSONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED 

- [ ] creating the random, ranged timing interval
- [ ] creating an animation effect that randomly chooses a color scheme for the blocks
- [ ] fixing the functionality so it would rerender on window resizeand the additionaly decoration on the pages.
